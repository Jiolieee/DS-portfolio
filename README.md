# DataScience-portfolio
Here I dumped most of my past projects developed in university courses.
I am also in the progress of developing more algo models, actively gaining insights from kaggle/github community.
The two dominant languages I use are R and Python.
Some of the libraries involved are Numpy, Panda, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn.
Hope this can be helpful to your learning and developments.
Pls dm me if you wish to collaborate or have interesting ideas about ML, NLP, anything cool!
